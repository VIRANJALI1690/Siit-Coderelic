# 5. Technology Stack

## Frontend Technologies
- **React.js (v19)**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. Chosen for its component-based architecture and widespread industry adoption.
- **Vite**: The build tool and development server. Chosen for its extreme speed and modern developer experience compared to traditional tools like Create React App.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework. Chosen for rapid UI development and easy customization without writing complex CSS files.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for high-quality animations and smooth page transitions.
- **React Router Dom**: For handling single-page application (SPA) navigation.
- **Axios**: For making clean and efficient HTTP requests to the backend.

## Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. Chosen for building scalable network applications using JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Chosen for its simplicity in creating RESTful APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure user authentication. It allows the server to verify the user's identity without storing sessions on the server.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For hashing passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring high security.

## Database & Storage
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, document-based database. Chosen for its flexibility in handling JSON-like data, which perfectly matches the JavaScript stack.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model application data.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service for managing images. Chosen to avoid storing heavy image files locally and to provide fast delivery via CDN.

## Tools & Utilities
- **VS Code**: The primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- **Postman/Insomnia**: Used for testing API endpoints during development.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaborative development.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: For managing project dependencies.
- **Lucide-React / React-Icons**: For professional and lightweight icons.

## Why this Tech Stack?
The **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) was chosen because it allows for an all-JavaScript development environment. This reduces context switching between languages and provides a unified, efficient workflow. The addition of **Tailwind CSS** and **Vite** ensures that the application is not only functional but also highly performant and modern in its visual design.
