# 1. Project Overview

## Project Title
**Siit Coderelic** - A Comprehensive Project Showcase and Collaboration Platform

## Problem Statement
In the current academic and professional environment, students and developers often struggle to showcase their technical projects in an organized manner. Traditional methods like sharing code via ZIP files or simple GitHub links often lack the visual context and detailed explanation needed for recruiters or peers to understand the project's complexity. There is a need for a dedicated hub where developers can publish, categorize, and document their work with rich media and structured information.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of **Siit Coderelic** is to provide a specialized platform for developers to host their project portfolios. It serves as a bridge between building a project and showcasing it to the world, offering a clean, user-friendly interface to manage multiple projects under a single profile.

## Objectives
- To provide a secure authentication system for users to manage their profiles.
- To enable users to upload and publish their projects with descriptions, screenshots, and links.
- To implement a searchable database of projects categorized by technology and domain.
- To create a visually appealing dashboard for users to track their contributions.
- To provide a collaborative environment where users can discover and learn from each other's work.

## Target Users
1. **Students**: To showcase their college projects and internships.
2. **Developers**: To build a professional portfolio of their side projects.
3. **Recruiters**: To browse and evaluate the technical skills of potential candidates.
4. **Academics**: To maintain a centralized repository of student submissions.

## Real-World Use Case
Imagine a final-year CS student who has built several impressive projects but doesn't have a single place to show them all off visually. With Siit Coderelic, the student can create a profile, upload screenshots of their apps, add descriptions, and share one single "Portfolio Link" on their resume. This allows recruiters to see the actual application UI and functionality before even looking at the source code.

## Summary
Siit Coderelic is a **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application designed as a social hub for developers. It features a modern, responsive frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS, and a robust backend powered by Node.js and Express. The platform allows users to register, log in, and publish detailed project entries including images (hosted on Cloudinary), descriptions, and live links, making project discovery and sharing seamless.
